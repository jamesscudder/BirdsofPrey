Analysis of persecution of birds of prey in the UK

This dataset contains details and locations of confirmed raptor persecution incidents in the UK from 2007 to 2020.
The original dataset can be found here: RSPB.

The data are collated by the RSPB Investigations Team, a specialist unit set up to assist the statutory agencies with the investigation and prosecution of crimes against wild birds. This is the most complete centralised set of known confirmed raptor persecution incident data for the United Kingdom, recorded consistently for several decades. Only the highest evidentially weighted incidents – those classified as ‘confirmed,’ are included in my analysis.

‘Confirmed’ incidents are those were circumstances indicate that an illegal act has taken place. These incidents are typically substantiated by evidence such as post-mortem or toxicological analysis, or reliable eyewitness evidence.

These figures represent only those incidents known to RSPB: many remain undetected and unreported, particularly those that occur in remote areas. Population studies and scientific reports therefore provide essential bigger picture information on the conservation impact of persecution for a number of raptor species.
